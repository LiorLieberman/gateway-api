# GEP-2162: Supported features in GatewayClass Status

* Issue: [#2162](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/issues/2162)
* Status: Provisional

## TLDR

This GEP proposes to enhance the [GatewayClassStatus](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/blob/f2cd9bb92b4ff392416c40d6148ff7f76b30e649/apis/v1beta1/gatewayclass_types.go#L185) to include a list of Gateway API features supported by the installed GatewayClass. 

## Goals

* Improve UX by enabling users to easily see what features the implementation (GatewayClass) support.

* Automatically run conformance tests based on the supported features populated in GatewayClass status.

* Provide foundation for tools to block or warn when unsupported features are used.

## Non-Goals

* Validate correctness of supported features published by the implementation. Meaning we don't intend to verify whether the supported features reported by the implementation are indeed supported.

## Introduction

The current [GatewayClassStatus](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/blob/f2cd9bb92b4ff392416c40d6148ff7f76b30e649/apis/v1beta1/gatewayclass_types.go#L185 is only used to store conditions the controller publishes.

Partnered with the [Conformance Profiles](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/blob/main/geps/gep-1709.md) work, we want to:

1. Improve UX by enabling users to easily see what features the implementation(GatewayClass) support.
1. Automatically run conformance tests based on the supported features populated in GatewayClass status.
1. Potentially build tooling to block or warn when unsupported features are used (more under [Future Work](#future-work)).

This doc proposes to enhance the GatewayClassStatus API so implementations could publish a list of features they support/don't support.

Implementations **must** publish the supported features before Accepting the GatewayClass.

Implementations are free to decide how they manage this information - common approaches could be either to maintain static lists of supported features OR generate them from their conformance tests results/reports as part of their CI.

## API

This GEP proposes API changes describes as follow:

* Update the `GatewayClassStatus` struct to include a string-represented list of `SupportedFeatures`.


```go
// GatewayClassStatus is the current status for the GatewayClass.
type GatewayClassStatus struct {
    // Conditions is the current status from the controller for
    // this GatewayClass.
    //
    // Controllers should prefer to publish conditions using values
    // of GatewayClassConditionType for the type of each Condition.
    //
    // +optional
    // +listType=map
    // +listMapKey=type
    // +kubebuilder:validation:MaxItems=8
    // +kubebuilder:default={{type: "Accepted", status: "Unknown", message: "Waiting for controller", reason: "Pending", lastTransitionTime: "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
    Conditions []metav1.Condition `json:"conditions,omitempty"`

    // SupportedFeatures is the features the GatewayClass support.
    // <gateway:experimental>
    // +kubebuilder:validation:MaxItems=64
    SupportedFeatures []string `json:"SupportedFeatures,omitempty"`
}
```

## Conformance Details

(TBD)

## Alternatives

### Re-using ConformanceProfiles structs

We could use the same structs as we do in conformance profile object, more specifically, the [ProfileReport](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/blob/main/conformance/apis/v1alpha1/profilereport.go#LL24C6-L24C19) struct.

Though it would be nice to have only one place to update, these structs seems to include much more data relevant to the conformance report but not for our use case. 

That said, conformance profiles are still at experimental stage, we could explore the option to create a shared struct that will be used both for the conformance reports and for the GatewayClass status.

### Instruct users to read from the future conformance profiles report

The current plan for conformance profiles is to also include centralized reporting. (more info in [gep-1709](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/blob/main/geps/gep-1709.md))
We could wait for this to be implemented and instruct users to read from that source to determine what features their installed GatewayClass support.

However, having the supported features published in the GatewayClass Status adds the following values:
* We could build a mechanism or a tool to block or warn when unsupported features are used.
* Users will be able to select the GatewayClass that suits their needs without having to refer to documentation or conformance reports.

This does not cover a future piece of work we want to implement which is to warn/block users from applying a Gateway API object if the installed GWC doesn't support it. (originally suggested in [#1804](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/issues/1804)).

## Future Work

### Research the development of an unsupported feature warning/blocking mechanism
Once the GatewayClass features support are is published into the status we could look into;

1. Using the supported features in the webhook to validate or block attempts to apply manifests with unsupported features.

    * Developing such mechanism looks like it would have to include cross-resource validation. (checking the GatewayClass while trying to apply a Route for example). This comes with a lot of caveats and we will need consider it carefully.

2. Build tooling to check and warn when unsupported features are used.
